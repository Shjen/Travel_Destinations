      <p>Italy is of course known for it's fresh food, especially Pasta!  From Penne to Fettuccini, they have it all!
        The markets are full of boisterious peddlers selling their wares of fresh vegetables, meats & cheese, fruits, and delicacies.
        Did I mention they make Pasta?  Did you know that Ramen is similar to italian pasta, except they use alkalinity to achieve the "bouncy noodle" texture that is so unique!
        <br><br><br>They may not be masters at Ramen, but they are definitely masters at making pasta of every variety!
        Pasta and Cheese aren't they only thing they excell at though, as their wine is reknowned around the world for their quality grapes.
        Afterall, one can't enjoy a good long Italian meal without wine pairing, right?
        Everytime my family visits they refer to it as "Eat-aly" since their whole trip revolves around food!  What a way to vacation!
